          <h3 style="text-align: center;">Mission</h3>
          <p>It is the mission of The little beginnings to take care of abandoned children bringing them to safety and into the loving arms of caretakers that will educate, love and raise them to become future leaders in their generation. We are committed to providing them the best care be it in terms of health, education, accommodation or disaster relief. We aim to never stop until every orphan in Canada is under a secure and nurturing roof. The Little beginnings also aims to provide the children with the highest level of education and guidance, so they can grow to be assets to their community and so that they can compete competitively for jobs, admissions and placement upon graduation. We aim to not only cater to children’s mental needs, but to provide a complete package, by catering to the physical, spiritual and emotional needs of the children as well.</p>

          <h3 style="text-align: center;">Vision</h3>
          <p>The vision of The Little Beginnings is to one day have a self-sustaining community consisting of a children’s home, orphanage, school, university, training center, women’s shelter, elderly person’s home, place of worship, hospital, library, park, play fields, technology center, shops, and other facilities that help a community to succeed. Our vision is to one day establish such communities all over the world. With the help of our generous donors and the dedicated team of volunteers, we hope to see The Little beginnings do the greater good in the society ensuring that no orphan is rendered homeless, jobless, and illiterate in our competitive cutting edge era. We envision a great world for our angels who are to be an immense contribution to our society.</p>

          <h2 style="text-align: center;">History and Origin</h2>
          <p>The Little beginnings was founded in 2008 by Mr. John Doe and his wife, Miranda. Mr. Doe had been a professor of Arts in University of Price before founding this orphan shelter in Canada. Being raised by monks himself, he saw the need of protection, care and education for the young children who are deprived of care and nourishment because they did not have a family. He so willingly wanted to build a secure shelter for the orphans so they could grow and prosper like they would have in a family. </p>
          <p>Having The little beginnings started off with a small building of 5 rooms, which was the home of Mr. Doe. He rescued 3 young boys from beside the Ontario Lake and provided them with medical care. That was like a signal from almighty to make what he had always wanted happen. The three boys are now in USA, completing their education. The family grew eventually, and with the help of so many donors and volunteers, The little Beginnings is on the path to accomplishing its vision and mission.
