        <h1>Welcome to The Little Beginnings website</h1>
        <p>The Little Beginnings is all about “Giving Hope” to those who are orphaned and deprived of a home or a family. Since 2008, The Little Beginnings has provided a loving home to Canada’s most vulnerable children – first orphans, and in later years those children removed from their homes due to neglect, abuse, domestic violence or substance abuse. Throughout our history, it has served over 5,000 children who have been denied their innocence and childhood years, and for many, the basic needs of life.</p>
        <p>Through the years, We have adapted to meet the needs of children and families. It all started as an orphanage has evolved into a multi-faceted, child caring facility but now, The little Beginnings continues to remain a top contender of providers of basic care education and family-like atmosphere. The Little Beginnings stays true to the mission of “Giving Hope” by being successful at catering to the needs of children.</p>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>The primary goals and objectives of The Little beginnings are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To meet the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual needs of orphaned and/or destitute children by providing them with love, care, nourishment, guidance, and the highest level of education.</li>
          <li>To provide all persons with training and access to the latest technology, concepts, and ideas as well as time-tested traditions and ideas</li>
          <li>To help children find themselves equipped to fulfil their respective roles in the global economy</li>
        </ul>
